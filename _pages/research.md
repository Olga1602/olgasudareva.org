My research lies at the intersection of macroeconomics and labour economics. I study how social norms, institutional environments, and technological change shape economic behaviour and long-run outcomes.

### Working papers
- *Assessing the Impact of Crime on Gender Disparities in Labour Market Outcomes* (with Sholeh Maani) — Job market paper.

### Interests
- Crime, safety perceptions, and labour supply
- Gender and household labour allocation
- Migration, cultural assimilation, and long-run outcomes
- AI tools for economic analysis and policy communication
