I am an economist whose research lies at the intersection of macroeconomics and labour economics. I study how social norms, institutional environments, and technological change shape economic development and inequality. My work combines empirical analysis with theory to examine labour supply decisions, gender disparities, and long-run economic outcomes.

My recent research also explores how advances in artificial intelligence and large language models can enhance economic analysis and policy evaluation.
